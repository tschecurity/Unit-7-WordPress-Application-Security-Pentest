In Exploit 2 challenge, user enumeration you are trying to figure out WordPress user credentials by enumeration, guessing login variables.
Tested in WordPress version 5.7.
According to https://wordpress.org/support/topic/stop-allowing-user-enumeration/, user enumeration is not considered a security threat, so user enermation vulnerabilities still exist, especially in new installs.
The objective is to figure out which usernames exist and look around the site to gather more info or clues to login information, such as PHP file, iFrame - source view. First make sure Burp Suite is running in background to capture the traffic of trying WordPress admin login attemps, first with intercept off. Then navigate to turn on intercept finding login attempt in proxy traffic. Then send to intruder in Burp Suite. Then, clear formatting such as extra characters like $. Also, be mindful of clearing out target position, leaving username and deleting cookie and rest of login info. Then set up payload options in Burp Suite, including admin user, then other possible system users. Then go to Grep match -delete the original values on the options tab in Burp Suite. Paste in error message from the WordPress user credentials (type in non existent user, to get error result). Then start payload attack. The goal is to find users in the payload attack results with the error message from the WordPress credentials error message. This means that these users exist in the WordPress instance.
